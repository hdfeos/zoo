; We need to readjust the limits of latitude and longitude. 
; HDF-EOS is using DMS(DDDMMMSSS.SS) format to represent degrees.
; To calculate the lat and lon in degrees, one needs to convert
; minutes and seconds into degrees. 

; The following is the detailed description on how to calculate the
; latitude  and longitude range based on lowright and upleft.
; One should observe the fact that 1 minute is 60 seconds and 1 degree 
; is 60 minutes. 

; First calculate the difference of .SS between lowright and upleft.
; Since the resulting number is very large, you need to specify /L64.

; Calculate the difference of SSS between lowright and upleft.

upleft_s = floor(upleft) MOD 1000
ds = lowright_s - upleft_s +dss/100;

; Calculate the difference of MMM between lowright and upleft.
lowright_m = floor(lowright/1000) MOD 1000
upleft_m = floor(upleft/1000) MOD 1000
dm = lowright_m-upleft_m +ds/60;

; Calculate the difference of DDD between lowright and upleft.
lowright_d = floor(lowright/1000000)
upleft_d = floor(upleft/1000000)
dd = lowright_d-upleft_d+dm/60

lat_limit = dd(1);
lon_limit = dd(0);

; We need to calculate the grid space interval between two adjacent points.
scaleX = lon_limit/xdimsize
scaleY = lat_limit/ydimsize

; Convert data type since it is 16 bit integer.
